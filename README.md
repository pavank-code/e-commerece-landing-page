# Anutex Next.js + Framer Motion Starter

This folder contains a minimal Next.js (App Router) scaffold with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS configuration files and Framer Motion listed in dependencies so you can port the existing `index.html` into React components.

How to run locally:

1. Open a terminal in `anutex-next` folder

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

2. Open http://localhost:3000

Notes:
- This is a scaffold. Replace placeholder components in `/components` with your full UI.
- Tailwind is configured but you should run the Tailwind CLI step if you customize it further.
